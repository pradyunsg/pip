pip is a volunteer maintained open source project.

## Becoming a maintainer

If you want to become an official maintainer, start by helping out.

As a first step, we welcome you to triage issues on pip's issue
tracker. pip maintainers provide triage abilities to contributors once
they have been around for some time (probably at least 2-3 months) and
contributed positively to the project. This is optional and highly
recommended for becoming a pip maintainer.

Later, when you think you're ready (probably at least 5 months after
starting to triage), get in touch with one of the maintainers and they
will initiate a vote among the existing maintainers.

```{note}
Upon becoming a maintainer, a person should be given access to various
pip-related tooling across multiple platforms. These are noted here for
future reference by the maintainers:

- GitHub Push Access
- PyPI Publishing Access
- CI Administration capabilities
- ReadTheDocs Administration capabilities
```
